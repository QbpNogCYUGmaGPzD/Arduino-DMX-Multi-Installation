Arduino-DMX-Multi-Installation
==============================

Location based interactive display with over 30 DMX LED lights. 


To connect the inside with the outside world of the library we created an interactive wall, over 20 meters high. 
ON the wall will be displayed:

Audio levels from inside vs outside
Daylight on a globe to show where people are awake
Number of vistors already inside
Weather reports
An interactive button to 'circus' the entire wall
